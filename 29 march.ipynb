    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "  Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function. The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients, multiplied by a tuning parameter alpha. This penalty term helps to shrink the coefficient estimates towards zero, and can be used to perform feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques such as ridge regression, which uses L2 regularization, Lasso regression has some differences in terms of the penalty term and the resulting coefficient estimates. Lasso regression tends to produce sparse coefficient estimates, meaning that many coefficients will be exactly zero. This makes it useful for feature selection and can help to identify the most important predictors in a dataset. In contrast, ridge regression tends to produce coefficient estimates that are small but non-zero, and may not perform as well for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between Lasso regression and other regression techniques is that Lasso can handle collinear predictors more effectively. This is because the L1 penalty term tends to push the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, so that only one of them may end up being selected while the others are set to zero. This can help to improve the stability and interpretability of the model.\n"

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to automatically perform variable selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero. This is because the L1 penalty term in Lasso Regression encourages sparse solutions, meaning that it tends to set some of the coefficients to exactly zero, effectively removing the corresponding features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be especially useful in situations where the number of features is large compared to the number of observations, or when some of the predictors are highly correlated. In such cases, it can be difficult to determine which features are truly important for predicting the target variable, and using Lasso Regression can help to identify the most relevant features and remove the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, by reducing the number of features in the model, Lasso Regression can help to improve the model's interpretability and reduce the risk of overfitting, which occurs when the model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. Therefore, Lasso Regression is a powerful tool for feature selection in many applications, such as in genetics, finance, and marketing.\n"

    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "   The interpretation of coefficients in a Lasso Regression model is similar to that of a standard linear regression model. Each coefficient represents the change in the response variable for a unit increase in the corresponding predictor, while holding all other predictors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because Lasso Regression shrinks some coefficients towards zero, it is possible for some coefficients to be exactly zero, meaning that the corresponding predictors are not included in the model. This can be useful for variable selection and model interpretation, as it can help to identify the most important predictors for the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the magnitude of the non-zero coefficients can be used to rank the importance of the predictors. Larger coefficients indicate stronger associations between the predictor and the response variable, while smaller coefficients suggest weaker associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the interpretation of coefficients in a Lasso Regression model can be affected by the scaling of the predictors. When the predictors are on different scales, the magnitude of the coefficients can be difficult to compare. Therefore, it is often recommended to standardize the predictors before fitting the Lasso Regression model to ensure that the coefficients are comparable.\n"

    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the\n",
    "model's performance?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    There are 2 main tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Alpha (Î»): This is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the L1 penalty term in the cost function. A larger value of alpha results in more regularization, which in turn leads to more coefficients being shrunk towards zero. Conversely, a smaller value of alpha leads to less regularization and can result in overfitting if the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Max iterations: This is the maximum number of iterations that the optimization algorithm is allowed to run before stopping. The optimization algorithm is used to minimize the cost function and find the optimal values of the coefficients. Setting a higher number of iterations can lead to a more accurate solution, but it can also increase the computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of these tuning parameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the Lasso Regression model. A large value of alpha can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model, but it can also lead to underfitting if the true coefficients are not close to zero. On the other hand, a small value of alpha can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance, especially when the number of predictors is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, setting the maximum number of iterations too high can result in longer computation time without improving the performance of the model, while setting it too low can result in a suboptimal solution. Therefore, it is important to tune these parameters carefully to achieve the best possible performance of the Lasso Regression model.\n"
